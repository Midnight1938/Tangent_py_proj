*** Project List:
**** [[file:/FlipkartPriceChkr/][Flipkart Price Check]]
+ Emails a user when price fals below a specific range
+ Looks for change in the price class of the provided flipkart Link
  - If its lower than the input it activates the url shortner API and email client
    * Then emails with the heading of the Product and set price. And body contains the link and price.
+ Refer to [[file:/FlipkartPriceChkr/Flipkart_Price_Chk.ipynb][Flipkart Jupyter File]] for more explaination

+ The program is not tested for all years and dates so problems may occur I'm not sure
+ The [[file:/Doomsday_Cal/Alternates.ipynb][jupyter Notebook]] includes the following:
  * An anchor year checker
  * Doomsday Calculation using modules

+ '[[file:/Doomsday_Cal/Test things.ipynb][Test Things]]' includes
  - Files used to make the python file itself.
  - Division of parts based on use for easy modification.
